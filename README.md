# CounterClockwise_2022
2022 - CounterClockwise prototype; Ver. 0.6.10

CounterClockwise is an independent game prototype with emotion, reasoning, and casual game tags. 

Due to force majeure, the source file repository was closed, and the final version was lost. 

This version of 0.6.10 seems to have some unfixed bugs; the menu functionality, credits information, and multiple language options are still in the earliest stages of the project, but luckily, the overall playable framework is complete and supports players playing normally to the end.
